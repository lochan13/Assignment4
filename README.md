# Deck of Cards - Java Program

This repository contains a menu-driven Java program that simulates a standard deck of 52 playing cards. The program implements various functionalities to create, manipulate, and analyze a deck of cards, adhering to the specifications of a programming assignment. Each card belongs to one of four suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades) and one of 13 ranks (Ace, 2-10, Jack, Queen, King).

## Features

The program provides the following methods as part of the `Deck` class:
1. **createDeck()**: Initializes or resets a deck of 52 cards (also available as the constructor).
2. **printDeck()**: Displays all cards in the deck.
3. **printCard()**: Prints a randomly selected card from the deck.
4. **sameCard()**: Finds and returns all cards with a specified suit.
5. **compareCard()**: Finds and returns all cards with a specified rank.
6. **findCard()**: Searches for a specific card by suit and rank.
7. **dealCard()**: Deals 5 random cards and removes them from the deck.
8. **shuffleDeck()**: Randomizes the order of cards in the deck.

A menu-driven interface in `Main.java` allows users to interact with these features seamlessly.
